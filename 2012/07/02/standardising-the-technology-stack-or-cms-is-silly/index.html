    <h1>Standardising the technology stack (or CMS) is silly</h1>
  </header> 
  <div class="body row">
    <div class="eight columns">
      <p>I have been involved in many "we want to move all our websites to one
technology" projects. Mostly Drupal. Mostly where people wanted to move
from a wild range of CMSes, forum-systems, blogging-tools and so on,
written in various languages towards everything-in-Drupal. Smart move,
you might think. Not often, I know now.</p>

<p>We all like car analogies, when it comes to websites, so here is one: my
1986 Volkswagen T3 camper. A great car. I know its engine (watercooled
1.6 boxer, best engine sound ever), I have gone trough its electrical
cirquits a few times and know them pretty well now.</p>

<p>I know where to find and buy secondhand or deadstock
replacement parts. I know the support-forums. And mostly, I can safely invest in knowing
the ins-and outs of the car, because I am pretty sure I will buy
Volkswagen Classic T3 Camper Vans for all my needs, forever, from now on. Or not.</p>

<p><img src="/images/inline/busje.jpg" alt="Busje" /></p>

<p>Off course not! No-one in his or her sane mind would buy a second such
camper-van to do the daily shopping, or for your daily commute. If I needed
a car for my daily commute, I would not buy a second,  rather expensive, fuel-gobbling,
always-something-needs-fixing van with all the camping-stuff built in,
but one that suits the needs much better, like a small, cheap Japanese car.</p>

<p>Yet this is the argument that goes when people choose to "Always use Foo for every of our sites from now on".</p>

<p>It is different if you are a mechanic, or auto-shop. Analogy for
"webbuilder". It makes more sense then, to become an expert on one
brand, year, engine-type of car. Specialists have a good place: we, the
consumers and clients will be able to find them when we need them. And I
prefer a Volkswagen mechanic with good Knowledge of the old-timer
transporter vans to fix my car.</p>

<p>This goes just as well for webdevelopment. A Drupal-only-shop will
be able to provide better sites for their clients,
because they know all the weird little quirks in that CMS inside out.
A dedicated python-developer knows much better where to find the most
up-to-date resources and tools. And so on.</p>

<p>But as a consumer, as a client, you are much better off to choose your
CMS, framework, programming language as it best fits the site, service or app you
want building. Rather then shoe-horning each and every website you want
into, say, Wordpress. I have seen it all: e-commerce platforms built on
top of Wordpress? Wordpress turned into a JSON-webservice system. Great ideas molded into
nothing, because it had to fit within what Wordpress can offer.</p>

<p>Do you really want to sacrifice all that, simply because you chose to standardise on that one CMS?</p>

<p>No, what you want, is the same as with your car, or cars: a good
and trustworthy mechanic who helps you with your old-timer camper-van as
well as your husbands commute-car. Or at the very least, two such
mechanics, one for each. You want trustworthy contractors and
service-managers who can help you with whatever problem you have.</p>

<p>You want a good partner, or set of partners who can offer you the best
tool and solution for each problem you have. And here is the other
problem: if that partner is a shop who standardised on one technology,
<em>that is what they are going to offer you</em>. There is no Ruby-on-Rails
developer who is going to say, <em>no, bad idea, you should not hire us.
Rails is really not the best tool for your job</em>. That is why you need
some basic knowledge.</p>

<p>Again, like with the car: you walk into a Volkswagen-dealer to ask what
car you need for your new building-company and you will end up with a
Volkswagen. Even though a secondhand Toyota pickup is probably a much
better fit. You need some basic idea of what you want and what fits.
Most people who buy a car, know that newer, smaller cars use less fuel.
And that (in The Netherlands, at least) driving Diesel is cheaper then
Gasoline. Most people also know that an €180k is far more
luxurious then a €400 Suzuki Alto. But you really should avoid
shoehorning all your needs into one system. Because that one system is
best at one area, you end up with a large range of websites that are not
working too well, too expensive (or too cheap); you will end up like me,
commuting to work by train, because doing it with my 1 liter
on 8.5 kilometer fuelgobbling van, is just too expensive ;). You will
end up using technology that is far from the best fit for a certain
problem.</p>

<p>Only when all your sites are near 100% equal, then it
makes sense to pick one and build every site with that technology.</p>

<p>And only if you insist on doing everything yourself, in-house, then it
makes sense to standardise on one technology. Just like I would have to
buy a second Volkswagen-van for my commuting, if I would insist on doing
all the maintenance myself; learning the ins-and-outs of a, say, Japanese
Diesel is too much for my simpleton programmer-brain.</p>

<p>Don't you just hate these car-analogies in IT :) ?</p>
